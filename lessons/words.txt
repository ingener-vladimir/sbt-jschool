The Java Collections Framework includes classes that implement List, Map, Queue, and Set.
On the OCA, you saw one such class. The class ArrayList implements the interface List.
You will learn about more of these later in this chapter. You also saw arrays on the OCA, such as int[].
An array is not part of the Collections Framework.
Since sorting and searching are similar between lists and arrays, both are covered on the exam.
Furthermore, since the OCP is cumulative, you are still expected to know how to work with arrays from the OCA.
